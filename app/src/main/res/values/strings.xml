        Here\'s your current picture of the night sky. How I hate the night.\n
        Use the date picker and "PICK AN IMAGE" button to choose a new image, use the "SAVE IMAGE" button

        Wretched, isn\'t it?

        Space is big. You just won\'t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean,
        you may think it\'s a long way down the road to the chemist\'s,
        but that\'s just peanuts to space.</string>
